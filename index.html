				<h2 id='about'>About</h2>
				<h3><p>I am studying to become a mechatronics engineer. I love robots, machines, and all things electrical and mechanical. I love tinkering and building things in my home lab/workshop, though I do not
				have as much time to do that as I would like due to schoolwork.<br><br>I started college at a community college with the hopes to be a web or graphic designer (I was stupid). After graduating, I realized I did not enjoy web design all that much and decided to become an engineer. After graduating with a 2 year degree in mechatronics engineering, I worked in a semiconductor fab for half a year before quitting to
				persue a 4 year degree.<br><br>I do still enjoy art/design somewhat. I do pixel art sometimes and I think I am kinda good at it sometimes. I also keep my web design skills polished by working on this website. Though there may be a few issues here and there.<br><br>If you need to reach me for some reason, Discord DMs or Reddit DMs are fine.</p>
